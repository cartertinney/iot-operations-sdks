# Samples and tutorials

> [!CAUTION]
>
> The samples and tutorials provided in this repository are for **demonstration purposed only**, and should not be deployed to a production system or included within an application without a full understanding of how they operate.
>
> Additionally some samples may use a username and password for authentication. This is used for sample simplicity and a production system should use a robust authentication mechanism such as certificates.

The following is a list of tutorials and samples that are available across all languages. Each language may have additional samples which can also be found within each language directory.

> [!TIP]
> Refer to the [getting started](/README.md#getting-started) documentation for setting up your development environment **prior** to running the tutorials and samples.

A :yellow_circle: mean the tutorial or sample is planned in the near future.

## Tutorials

The tutorials listed below are step-by-step instructions to deploy a fully functioning application to a cluster and observer the functioning output.
